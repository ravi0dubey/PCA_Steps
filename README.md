# PCA(Principal Component Analysis)

It is used for dimension reductions. We do not need all features of the data. Features can be reduced using Feature selection technique
but most importantly we use PCA to reduce the dimension

Note: PCA is performed only on Independent columns

**Steps for PCA**
1. Standardization of the data
2. Covariance Matrix
3. Eig Value and Eig Vector
4. Find Principal Component
